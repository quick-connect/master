  This is an example of HTML Fragment extension pattern that inserts the response from REST API as a HTML fragment into this page.<br>
  The "Lookup" button was dynamically added by WebExtension when this page was loaded.<br>
  When you click the button, an AddressLookup REST API is called through proxy.<br>
  Once the responce came back, an address list will be shown.<br>
  If you change the zopcode to 100-0001 and click the button, the returned address will be set to the from without showing the address list.

Zipcode <input id="zipcode" type="text" value="100-0006"><br>
Prefecture <input id="pref" type="text" value=""><br>
Address <input id="address" type="text" value="">

  This example shows how to call a REST API and handle the response.<br>
  Before sending the response HTML back to browser, AddressLookupUpdater is compiled and executed.<br>
  Then, the Updater inserts two script tags in head tag (WebExtension.js and AddressLookup.js).<br>
  Also it adds a Lookup button to fire lookup JavaScript function.<br>
  When user clicks on the Lookup, lookup function is invoked and it calls AddressLookup REST APT and receives a response.<br>
  Finally, the address in the response is set to the address form on the screen.
